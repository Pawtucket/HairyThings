<p>Derek pulled back hard on the control stick, but their hovercraft was barely responding. Senator Black and Audrey had both fastened their seatbelts. The hovercraft had lost power, and was dropping towards the trees below them at an alarming rate.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing I can do,” Derek exclaimed. “We’re going to crash!”</p>
<p>Trees scraped the bottom of the craft, and then it spun and slid to a stop in the middle of a baseball diamond.</p>
<p>The rear door opened, and Maxwell stumbled out. He leaned over and vomited. Derek guided Audrey out into the field.</p>
<p>“Are you okay, sir?” Derek asked.</p>
<p>“I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“That was the worst landing I’ve ever experienced,” Audrey said.</p>
<p>“We need to get to the closest Berenstain Deli,” Maxwell said. “We definitely can’t stay here. Grab her, and let’s go.”</p>
<p>They weaved into the dugout and then through an opening in the fence. They had landed on the southwest edge of the Furwood University’s campus. They stopped at the side of a road which sat between them and the rest of campus.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to get very far unless we figure out a way to blend in,” Maxwell said. He could already feel the eyes of the drivers who were driving by them.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a car pulled onto the shoulder, and a voice said, “Do you need a lift?”</p>
<p>Derek peeked in at the driver, who appeared to be a wolf. “Yeah, we need to find the closest Berenstain Deli. Do you know where that is?”</p>
<p>“Sure I do,” he said. “I’m a frequent customer. Hop in.”</p>
<p>Derek urged Audrey into the back seat, and Maxwell sat in the front. “This is Derek, and my name is Max. Behind me, that’s Audrey.”</p>
<p>“Great to meet you,” The wolf said. “My name is Roger.” He applied the gas, and pulled into traffic.</p>
<p>They headed away from campus. Every once in a while, they would pass a police officer or SWAT truck and Roger would hid his head.</p>
<p>“Are you in some kind of trouble?” Derek asked.</p>
<p>“Are you?” Roger shot back. “I saw you climb out of that hovercraft. And, I know that’s the president’s daughter. I’m not stupid, you know.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t answer his question,” Maxwell pointed out.</p>
<p>“Look, I need a way out of here. Can you help me out?”</p>
<p>“We’re not going anywhere you’d want to be,” Derek said. Maxwell cleared his throat. “But, if you help get us into the Berenstain Deli, then I’ll see what we can do.”</p>
<p>Roger smiled. “Then, let’s get started.”</p>
<p>They pulled into what appeared to be a much more heavily trafficked street. “Sir, why are we going to the deli,” Derek asked.</p>
<p>“The crates we send over all have the ability to be recalled back into our universe. It’s basically the same technology that was built into our limousine. All we need to do is trip a mechanism and all ride home in one.”</p>
<p>“If it’s that easy,” Audrey asked, “why hasn’t anybody already done what you’ve suggested?”</p>
<p>“Not everybody can activate them. They’re encrypted.”</p>
<p>Roger pulled them into the parking lot in front a mall. Set into the center was the Berenstain Deli. “So, what’s the plan?”</p>
<p>“Let’s all go in,” Maxwell said. “Derek, Audrey and I will slip in through the back. Roger, you create a distraction out front. When we’re ready, we’ll get you and go over together.”  </p>

<p>A dozen officers had already swarmed around the crashed hovercraft by the time Stella had landed.</p>
<p>“They survived,” a frog reported. “We found signs of vomit, and three sets of tracks. One set belongs to Audrey; we’re not sure who the other two are.”</p>
<p>“They couldn’t have gotten very far on foot,” Stella said. “But, they most likely headed towards campus.” She pulled out her cell phone and dialed Morty’s number. “Morty, where are you?”</p>
<p>“I’m on my way to the local Berenstain’s Deli, to follow up on a hunch.”</p>
<p>“We found the crashed hovercraft, but haven’t found Audrey or her kidnappers. I think they might hide somewhere on campus.”</p>
<p>“When I’m done, I’ll join you,” Morty said.</p>
<p># # #</p>
<p>A goat wearing spectacles greeted Roger from behind the deli counter. “How can I help you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, uh, I’d like a hamburger and french fries. But, make the hamburger out of your ‘special meat,’ if you know what I mean,” Roger said with a wink.</p>
<p>“Certainly,” the goat turned and dropped a patty onto the grill.</p>
<p>Roger was just getting swept up by the sound and smell of the sizzling meat, when he felt something poke him in the center of his back.</p>
<p>“Roger Potterfield,” a voice said, “you’re under arrest for murder.”</p>
<p>Roger looked over his shoulder to find a very serious looking fox wearing a business suit staring back at him. He held in his right hand a taser weapon which remained firmly planted into his back.</p>
<p>“Look man, you’ve got it all wrong,” Roger said. “I didn’t kill my parents.”</p>
<p>“You’ll need to try harder than that to convince me,” Morty said. “I saw your dorm room, and the wounds on their corpses.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m telling you the truth. I blacked out.”</p>
<p>“Whatever. You’re under arrest. We’ll sort everything else out later.” Morty was reaching for his handcuffs when a pan suddenly smashed into his face. He reeled backwards, catching his balance on a nearby table. Roger used the opportunity to leap over the counter and race for the back.</p>
<p>“Hey,” the deli employee shouted. “You’re not allowed back there!”</p>
<p>Morty picked up his taser, and aimed it at the goat. “Do you have any idea what you’ve just done?” he demanded. He pulled out his radio. “This is Special Agent Fox requesting back up. I’ve spotted Roger.” He gave the deli’s address, then put his radio away.</p>
<p>“You! What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Bill.”</p>
<p>“Well, Bill. What’s back there?”</p>
<p>“J-just a break room and storage.”</p>
<p>“You better hope he hasn’t gotten away. Interfering with a federal agent is a major crime.”</p>
<p>Morty maneuvered around the counter and stepped through the door marked “Employees Only.” he followed a hallway that lead to a set of double doors. He leaned up against the doors. He could hear several voices emanating from the next room. One of them belonged to Roger.</p>
<p>He bent down low, and slowly opened one of the doors. He crept through the opening, and then behind a stack of boxes. The room appeared to be used for storing supplies and ingredients for the deli’s food. Several large crates sat in the middle of the warehouse.</p>
<p>“He tried to arrest me. He said I murdered my parents,” Roger said.</p>
<p>“Murdered your parents? Is this true?” A second voice asked. It sounded male to Morty, although the accent seemed unusual.</p>
<p>“I-I don’t know,” Roger stammered. “I blacked out. I wasn’t sure what I did, but I knew it was bad.”</p>
<p>“Derek, keep a watch on the door, in case this agent gains consciousness. Roger, help me empty this crate.”</p>
<p>Morty knelt down lower. He was sorely outnumbered, but felt like he couldn’t wait any longer. He drew his taser, and was almost ready to make his move, when something struck him from behind, and pain spread across his head as his body flopped against the cold hard floor.</p>
<p>When Morty awoke, he discovered that he was tied up, undressed, and sitting inside a large metal container next to a lioness he recognized as the President’s daughter. She was also undressed. He noticed that her stomach protruded out into what appeared to be a baby bump, and he surmised that she was pregnant.</p>
<p>But, then he noticed his own gut which had a similar roundness to it.</p>
<p>“He’s awake.” Roger stepped into the container. He brandished Morty’s taser. “What are you going to do with him?” he asked.</p>
<p>“He’s coming back with us, too,” a familiar voice said. Morty spotted the source of that voice: someone who appeared to be ape like, yet almost entirely hairless. He was accompanied by another ape, who appeared to be half as hairy.</p>
<p>“Why?” Roger insisted.</p>
<p>“They’re experiments that my government will want back,” Maxwell explained. “Normally, we’d send a retrieval team, but given the circumstances I figured we might as well take care of them ourselves.”</p>
<p>“I’m nobody’s experiment,” Morty said. “And, whatever you’re planning, you’re not going to get away with it.”</p>
<p>“I would beg to differ,” Maxwell said. He seemed to make a final change that struck him as satisfactory, then ushered everybody into the container. “Quick, everybody inside.”</p>
<p>Derek stepped into the container, followed by Maxwell. Maxwell watched a countdown on his phone.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was an explosion from somewhere in the back of the warehouse, and the clamor of dozens of voices. Maxwell turned to Roger. “Go see what’s going on. Oh, hey, and you’ll want this.” he offered the wolf the hamburger he had ordered.</p>
<p>“But the countdown--”
“Don’t worry, I’ll pause it. We need another distraction.”</p>
<p>Roger stepped to the doorway, and began to lean out. Maxwell gave him a swift kick which sent him sprawling across the floor, then sealed the doors. The countdown on his phone continued.</p>
<p>Roger grabbed his hamburger and devoured it quickly as a team of armed AIF officers swarmed around him. He was lifted up by one of the officers as a female leopard appeared.</p>
<p>“Roger Potterfield, you’re under arrest!”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, not that again,” Roger said, rolling his eyes.</p>
<p>An agent appeared from around a stack of storage containers. “There is no sign of Agent Fox anywhere. But, the deli employee is dead.”</p>
<p>Before Starla could respond, the room was filled by a low rumble, and everybody was thrown backwards by a huge shockwave. Roger was the first to recover, and clambered towards the sealed container. “No! You promised!”</p>
<p>The container was slowly being enveloped by a film of what appeared to be a reflective oil.</p>
<p>“Open that container! Quick!” Stella shouted.</p>
<p>But, before anybody could react, the container winked out of existence.</p>
