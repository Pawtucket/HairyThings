<p>Derek watched as the restaurant patrons who had been sitting peacefully in their chairs all leaped up in unison. As they closed in, they formed a circle around the President’s table. He glanced at Audrey.</p>
<p>“Did you know about this?” he asked.</p>
<p>She nodded, but didn’t say anything. He could see that she sympathized with them.</p>
<p>“You’re making a mistake,” Maxwell said, squirming to break free from the grip of the thug that held him in place.</p>
<p>Derek looked straight at Audrey’s eyes, and whispered, “I”m sorry.” He reached into his coat jacket, and produced a small, grey orb. Without hesitation, he pressed the top of it, and threw it up as far as he could. It bounced against a far wall. Mid flight, it began to emit a high pitched screeching sound that sent everybody cowering for the floor, their hands covering their ears. Maxwell and Derek broke free of the President’s goons, their hands over their ears. Maxwell motioned to Audrey, who had crouched underneath the table. “Grab her!”</p>
<p>Derek slid underneath the table, and in one swift motion grabbed Audrey by her arms and slipped a stun gun out of the holster of the nearby secret service agent. He pointed it at him and fired, incapacitating him. He next aimed it at Audrey’s chest as they both stood up.</p>
<p>“We’re getting out of here, Berenstain,” Maxwell said. “Anything happens to us, your daughter dies.”</p>
<p>“Everybody...back off!” The president shouted. The crowd hesitated. “You won’t make it out of here alive,” he growled. He looked at Audrey. “Stay calm, I’ll get you back.”  Somewhere in the distance, there was the sound of crunching plastic, and the sonic grenade’s tone began to dissipate, as did its effects.</p>
<p>Audrey whimpered. “No, father...don’t do this!”</p>
<p>But, the two men were already pulling her away towards a side exit. They found themselves inside a staircase that they followed to the roof.</p>
<p>On top of the building, they found an unattended hovercraft. Derek climbed into the cockpit as Maxwell forced Audrey into a seat between them.</p>
<p>The roof access door swung open, and guards clambored out onto the roof, their guns drawn.</p>
<p>“Can you drive this?” Maxwell asked.</p>
<p>“We will find out,” Derek muttered, hitting what he thought was the ignition. The engines screamed to life as he pulled them up off the roof, then flying forward across the city scape of Pawtucket.</p>
<p>“We can’t go back to the breach point if Berenstain’s captured it,” Maxwell said. “We’ll need to find another way across.”</p>
<p>“You’re free now,” Audrey said. “When will you let me go?”</p>
<p>“We can’t, really,” Maxwell said. “You’re coming back with us, to our universe.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me, sir.” Derek asked. “But, why?”</p>
<p>“Because she’s our first viable host. If her father is cutting us off like he threatened, I don’t want to lose her.” Maxwell looked at Audrey. “You’re pregnant, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>She didn’t answer, but didn’t really need to.</p>

<p>“You’ve brought me a very interesting specimen.” Morty looked up as his friend, Professor Jack Orwell, exited his lab. Morty had been rubbing his stomach, trying to relieve a sharp pain that had been bothering him off and on for months now. Today, it was stronger, and accompanied by movement or fluttering. “This is one hundred percent pure meat.”</p>
<p>“Meat? As in the flesh of an animal?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The consumption of other animals had been outlawed for almost half a century, following the end of the last world war. Since then, scientists had found a way to synthesize meat from vegetables.</p>
<p>“Do you know who--or what--it comes from?”</p>
<p>“That’s the other thing,” Jack said. “It doesn’t match any known type of animal. Almost as if it doesn’t come from here.”</p>
<p>Morty’s eyes widened with a burst of sudden realization. “Here? As in Pawtucket?”</p>
<p>“No,” Jack stated. “As in not from this planet.”</p>
<p>###</p>

<p>President Berenstain entered the situation room. He sat down at the end of a table which had been placed in the center of the room. “What do we know so far?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing so far, but every agency will be looking for them, sir.” Cottontail said. Also, we haven’t picked up any signs of a new breach.”</p>
<p>“I want to know the moment that you do.” The President turned to Admiral Weaver, a Gorilla who wore an army uniform decorated with medals and five stars. “Admiral, I want a strike team assembled and ready to go as soon as a breach is opened.”</p>
<p>“Sir? You’re sending men through the breach?” Weaver asked.</p>
<p>“First, it will be a reconnaissance mission,” Berenstain said. “If we fail to get my daughter back, then she will need to be rescued.”</p>
<p>“But, sir, if we send armed troops . . . that might be viewed as aggressive.”</p>
<p>“They’ve already sent armed men through, General. We’d be merely returning the favor.” The President looked at Cottontail. “Show them the footage.”</p>
<p>The giant screen towards the front of the situation room flickered to life. Surveillance Video taken from different locations inside the White House began to play. “Show them the infrared.”</p>
<p>The footage repeated, and now three figures could be seen clearly, moving quickly down each hallway. They followed the stairway to the second level. The last shot was of two of them entering Audrey’s room.</p>
<p>“Who were they?” Weaver asked.</p>
<p>“Humans, using some kind of camouflage,” Berenstain said. “They did something to my daughter. Some kind of experiment, and now they want her back.”</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Derek pulled their craft as high as he dared as they passed over the northernmost edge of Furwood University’s campus. He and Maxwell had both concluded that the university would have the equipment that they needed to open up a breach to their world.</p>
<p>“Things look very busy down there,” Maxwell said. “If we try to land, we’ll be spotted by those other pilots.”</p>
<p>Almost as if on cue, their radio crackled into life. “This is Agent Feline of the AIF. You are in restricted air space. Alter course or you will be forced down.”</p>
<p>“Don’t answer,” Maxwell urged. “But change course, make it look like we’re leaving.”</p>
<p>Derek steered them into a turn.</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Starla studied the rogue through binoculars. “I don’t see any signs of Audrey,” she said. “But the craft meets the description of the one that was stolen.”</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s a match?” Her pilot asked.</p>
<p>“I’m confident of it. Keep following it.” Her phone began to ring, and she picked it up. “Agent Feline.”</p>
<p>“Starla, I think I have a lead on that wrapper I found in Roger’s trash can. And, is there anything new on the president’s daughter?”</p>
<p>“That’s good news. And, I think so. We’re following the craft right now that her kidnappers stole. What did you find out about the meat?”</p>
<p>“That it is one hundred percent real.”</p>
<p>“Real meat? That’s impossible. There’s no way the campus would permit it.”</p>
<p>“Regardless, it’s in his trash can and left over from a meal,” Morty said. “Also, it doesn’t match any known species on our planet.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Have you ever heard of the Hidden Species theory?” Morty asked.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“The theory says that there is another type of species that visits our world, and conducts experiments on us when we’re asleep.”</p>
<p>“What? Those are just stories.”</p>
<p>“For years, there have been reports of people waking up from sleep with mysterious aches, or hair missing. Or marks on their face.” Morty paused as he gave his stomach a thoughtful rub. “The theory is that this is the results of experimentation, and that the Hidden Species is behind it.”</p>
<p>“Well, if any of that was at all true, what does it have to do with Roger?”</p>
<p>“It would explain the meat on the wrapper,” Morty said. “From an unknown source. It could be from this other species that nobody has ever seen before.”</p>
<p>“Agent Feline, look.”</p>
<p>Starla leaned forward, and followed her pilot’s pointed finger to the forward windshield where she could see the hovercraft they were following was dropping into a nosedive. “Morty, I have to go. I think we’ll be getting some answers very soon.”</p>
