<h2>Morty’s Journal</h2>
<h3>Day 19</h3>
<p>It has been nearly a month since we arrived on this world, and we haven’t seen anybody since we escaped the soldiers outside that house. Of course, it took us a few days to reach an area that wasn’t flooded, and then we walked for a few miles before we reached what appears to be a shopping center. That was ten days ago, and we’ve barely explored half of this massive structure.</p>
<p>Audrey has adjusted well to our new surroundings. She seems to know a lot about humans, but resists sharing too much with me. Our government has known about this alternative Earth for decades, and have traded access to our world for supplies.</p>
<p>We spend most of our time rummaging through the abandoned stores for supplies we will be able to take with us when we are ready to move on. I’m not sure, though, when that would be, or where we should go next. Audrey has suggested that it would be better for us to just stay where we are until we are rescued, but we can expect that to happen.</p>
<p>However, I do want to be prepared in case there is ever an opportunity to get some kind of message through to our people back at home, so I will be making a record of our experiences here.</p>
<h3>Day 25</h3>
<p>Today Audrey and I agreed we would explore a new part of the center. I woke up feeling queasy. I assumed it was from hunger, so I ate breakfast. It helped me feel better, but as we were starting on our trip I started to feel sick to my stomach again. A few minutes later, I threw up on the ground.</p>
<p>“Are you going to be okay?” Audrey asked, gingerly rubbing my back with her hand. We were both wearing parkas we had found in one of the stores devoted to camping gear. “Do you want to go back to our camp, and rest?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said, wiping my chin with my sleeve. “If we wait, we’ll lose daylight.”</p>
<p>“Morty, you’ve been throwing up a lot these last few mornings,” Audrey said.</p>
<p>“Probably just something I ate, or side effects of being over here, maybe,” I offered. “I’m fine.”</p>
<p>I began walking again towards the north wing of the shopping center. The different sections had been blocked off by security gates, and we had no way to release them. Fortunately, this part of town still had power, and the lights cycled on and off on a schedule.</p>
<p>When my stomach spasmed, I thought I was starting to feel sick again, but then realized it was completely different type of sensation. I never said anything to Audrey, but I had gained a lot of weight since we had been on this Earth. It was something I had been concerned about months ago, but lately it had been more noticeable, especially in my stomach. And, I sometimes felt like I had no energy for anything.</p>
<p>We stopped in front of the glass doors which lead into our latest, unexplored section of this shopping structure. I jammed a screwdriver I had shaped into a makeshift key into the door’s keyhole, and wiggled it around until the lock released. We both flicked on flashlights, and entered a space which appeared to have been dedicated to eating. Names of restaurants were mounted on both walls, and the space was filled with tables and chairs.</p>
<p>“Charming,” Audrey said.</p>
<p>“Well, let’s look around,” I said.</p>
<p>We walked deeper into the mall. The first store we passed was filled with electronics. I stuffed a handful of batteries into my backpack. Audrey pulled a box containing portable CB radios off of one of the shelves.</p>
<p>“These are communication devices,” she offered. “They might come in handy.”</p>
<p>“They could,” I agreed. </p>
<p>She opened the box, popped the devices out of their plastic coverings and handed one to me. It took some time, but we finally were able to open the covers for the battery compartments, and slip in batteries.</p>
<p>Audrey’s radio beeped to life with the flick of a switch. Mine did the same.</p>
<p>“I’ll be on channel nine,” I said, after adjusting my radio.</p>
<p>Audrey adjusted the frequency on hers, and then clipped it onto her belt. “If we split up, we can cover more ground.”</p>
<p>“Sounds good,” I said. “And, meet back here in an hour.”</p>
<p>The first couple of stores that I tried were locked tight, so I could not get to anything that was inside. The third store I checked contained clothes which we didn’t need, but the store at the end, identified by the word “Sears,” was unlocked and stocked with an assortment of items. I found an aisle filled with tools in the very back.</p>
<p>Suddenly, my radio erupted with the sound of static. I removed it from my belt, and pressed the call button. “Audrey, how’s it going?” I asked. After a minute, the radio crackled, and I heard a response, but the voice sounded different.</p>
<p>“Hello? Hello? Who is there?”</p>
<p>“My name is Mordecai,” I said. “What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Angel. Angel Barnes.” There was a click on the other end, then what sounded like shuffling followed by a new voice. This one sounded male.</p>
<p>“Hello?”</p>
<p>“Hello,” I responded. “Are you in danger?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Are you military?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said.</p>
<p>“Did you escape detention?”</p>
<p>“No, we only arrived here a while ago.” I waited for a response, but there was only static. I waited a few more minutes, but heard only static.</p>
<p>Audrey had heard the conversation. We discussed it while we search Sears.</p>
<p>“If they are humans, we can not let them see us,” Audrey said. “They won’t understand.”</p>
<p>“But, they could help us,” I insisted. “Or we could help them.”</p>
<p>“Here, animals are subservient to humans,” Audrey said. “Humans aren’t ready to find out that we exist. We’re too alien too them.”</p>
<p>At that point, I let the topic go, but hadn’t given up hope.</p>
<h3>Day 42</h3>
<p>Audrey and I have surveyed the majority of the shopping center, and assembled enough supplies to survive for several months.</p>
<p>We have armed ourselves with crossbows and arrows from the camping store that we’ve claimed as our homebase. When we aren’t salvaging the neighborhood for supplies, we practice with the bow and arrows. Audrey is a natural.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve been handling more of the salvaging on my own, as Audrey’s pregnancy has progressed. When I’ve asked, she has guessed that she is about seven months pregnant. She has also noticed my expanding gut, and asks me when my baby will born.</p>
<p>I’ll admit that my weight gain has gotten to be an impediment. I can not move as fast, and my joints ache all of the time. I haven’t had as many problems with nausea, but I’ve continued to have severe indigestion that has kept me up at night.</p>
<p>Audrey had been very guarded about who the father of her baby is. Today she talked a little bit more about it during target practice.</p>
<p>“I told you that the humans have been invading our world,” She said. “What my father has suspected for months is that they’ve been conducting science experiments. Taking blood samples, injecting unsuspecting individuals with drugs, and then monitoring their effects.”</p>
<p>I lifted my bow, lined up the arrow with the bull’s eye, and fired. “I had heard rumors, but never had proof.”</p>
<p>“Neither did we, until my father caught them on camera, inside the White House. They had arrived there to experiment on me,” Audrey said. “You want to know who the father is, but I’m not even sure.” She fired her bow, but the arrow missed its mark.</p>
<p>I glanced at her round belly, trying to imagine what kind of baby such an experiment would produce. “Do you know any more? How they select their targets? Anything like that?”</p>
<p>“No,” She said. “At first, my father wanted to keep them out. Then, when that didn’t work he decided he would beat them at their own game. But, first he needed a way to enter their world.” She glanced upward. “With any luck, the stunt they pulled with the boxcar left a tear wide enough for my father to exploit.”</p>
<p>“If you’re talking about an invasion, it doesn’t seem worth it.”</p>
<p>“The humans live together in cities. We are only on the outskirts,” she said. She absentmindedly rubbed her stomach. “I can’t wait to have this thing out of me,” she said. “And, I expect that my father will come at any moment.” She lifted her bow, aimed carefully, and shot an arrow into the exact center of the bull’s eye.</p>
<h3>Day 100</h3>
<p>This morning, every joint in my body hurt. I could barely hobble down to the bathroom. As I brushed my fur, I studied my body. My stomach was big and around, as though I had swallowed a beach ball. I could feel a familiar flutter. I rubbed my stomach gently. The motion helped to reduce the fluttering and was very soothing.</p>
<p>Audrey had not left her tent in the last four days other than to eat briefly and maybe to say a few words. We both could tell that she was getting closer to delivery.</p>
<p>I lifted up the flap on the front of the tent and leaned in. “Is there anything I can pick up for you on my patrol?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Another pillow, maybe,” she said. I looked around and grinned. Her tent was filled from corner to corner with approximately nine pillows.</p>
<p>“I definitely will see what I can do.”</p>
<p>“How are you doing?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Sore, but I’ll live. Just worry about you,” I said.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Moving had gotten easier once I had been up for a little while. I gathered my gear, and headed into the more distance parts of the building. My destination was Sears which had a large stock of pillows. We also needed new batteries for our flashlights and radios.</p>
<p>I was passing through the food court, when I heard a tapping sound on the door. I turned around, and saw a small human with long blonde hair peering through the glass windows. I vaulted over, and unlocked the door.</p>
<p>“You have to help me, they’re after me,” the human stammered.</p>
<p>“Who?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The cullers.” For the first time, it looked directly at me, studying the fur on my hands and my face. “Are you wearing a costume?” It asked incredulously.</p>
<p>“Not exactly,” I said, wondering if I should just go with the costume idea for now. “I’m Mordecai.”</p>
<p>“Morte--we talked on the radio. I’m Angel! Angel Barnes.”</p>
<p>I could hear the sound of a revving engine. I pointed to the electronic store which sat just on the other side of the food area. “We should head deeper in.”</p>
<p>Once we reached the store where we had found the batteries, I encouraged Angel to crouch low and out of sight while I watched the door. So far, I didn’t see anybody.</p>
<p>“What happened?” I asked her.</p>
<p>“My dad and I were making a run to the pharmacy. My brother has been sick. Cullers appeared, and they said they were going to arrest my dad.”</p>
<p>“Why? Did your dad break a law?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No, they’ve taken everybody from my town. They said they needed to relocate us for our safety, but my dad said that was a lie.”</p>
<p>“Angel, if that’s a lie, then what’s the truth?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” she said. “Nobody knows. But it’s been a year, and nobody’s who has been culled has ever come back.”</p>
<p>“And these cullers...are they police? Or military?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes they’re soldiers, other times just men with guns,” Angel said.  </p>
<p>I pulled out my radio. If the cullers did come here, they could find Audrey. But, Angel pushed it out of my hands before I could transmit. “No! They monitor all of the frequencies!”</p>
<p>I put the radio down. </p>
<p>“That’s why my dad didn’t want me to talk to you. We weren’t sure who you were.” Angel said. “Or that you were into cosplay.”</p>
<p>“Okay, but I have a friend who I need to warn. We’ll have to go to her together, though.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>When we reached the exterior of the camping store, there were already two vehicles parked there that hadn’t been there when I had left. Seven men dressed in black armored uniforms were standing in a circle around another human who I didn’t recognize. As we got closer, I realized that Audrey was also there, laying on the ground. The non-militarized human seemed to be speaking with her.</p>
<p>“What are they doing?” I exclaimed. “Audrey!” My shout drew the attention of the soldiers, who dispersed from their circle, and drew their weapons. I already drawn my crossbow.</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” Angel said. “My dad is a veterinarian. </p>
<p>One of the militarized humans stepped closer to me, and began to speak. “I’m Agent Fred Miller, with Homeland Security. We’ve been looking for that little girl.”</p>
<p>“I need you to return my friend,” I said.</p>
<p>“Dr.. Barnes here says that she is in labor,” Miller said. “He also says that he has never encountered a lioness like her. He was just saying that she’s one-of-a-kind when you walked up.”</p>
<p>“This woman needs to be taken to a hospital,” Angel’s father shouted. “The baby could come at any moment.” He glanced at me, then stood up. “My God,” he exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Daddy, this is Mortecai,” Angel offered. “He’s the one we heard on the radio.”</p>
<p>“You’re male?” Dr. Barnes asked me.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>
<p>“A fox, I assume?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said, starting to feel annoyed.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know how, but you’re pregnant too.”</p>
