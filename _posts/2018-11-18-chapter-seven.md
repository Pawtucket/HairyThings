Morty started his run, passing his street and heading into the Pawtucket Community Park. He weaved between trees, and waved to joggers who passed him by. As he ran, he felt his body start to drag with every twenty feet or so. He looked down, and saw that his belly was beginning to balloon out.

He pressed on, leaving the park and entering the neighboring cemetery. He leaned on one of the tombstones to try to catch his breath, his stomach weighing him now. By now, it had grown unnaturally large. He could barely wrap his arms around it. His knees bent from the strain.

Suddenly, two strong hands gripped his arm. He look to his left, and saw his wife, Maureen, standing next to him. “It’s the baby we’ve always talked about,” She said with a warm smile.

“I need you,” Morty said. He watched as his stomach quivered. It had grown translucent enough that he could see the baby inside it. “I miss you.”

“I’ll always be with you,” Maureen replied. She stepped backwards. Morty’s body sagged lower to the ground. “Stay strong. Always remember who you are.”

Morty watched as Maureen’s body began to sink, as if she was standing on quicksand.. A thick haze filled the air, until he could barely see three feet in front of him. Unbelievably tired, he laid down on his back as a bright light enveloped him.

Morty blinked, and found himself strapped onto a hospital bed. He was in a line up of beds that went for as far as he could see, each with occupants who were as pregnant as he was. Some writhed in pain, fighting against their restraints. Echoes of moans and screams filled the long hallway. The beds were on a conveyor belt which moved them closer and closer to some type of surgical bay.

He felt movement in his abdomen, and pain shot across his body.

“Morty!” He looked behind him, and spotted Angel running towards him. “We found him! Daddy, we found him!”

Dr. Barnes joined him, followed by Senator Maxwell.

“Thank God. We’ve got to get you out of here.”

“I don’t understand,” Morty muttered. He shot a look towards Maxwell. “What’s he doing here?”

“I can explain later,” Maxwell said. “Right now, you are in more danger than you realize.”

“You kidnapped the President’s daughter,” Morty spat. “Your people invaded our world!”

“Yes, we did,” Dr. Barnes interjected as he cut through the straps on Morty’s legs. “But, I think once you heard the Senator’s explanation, you’ll understand.” He hoisted Morty to a sitting position. “Can you stand?”

“I don’t know.” Morty strained to stand up, then grimaced under a wave of pain. The floor shifted, and they were drawn closer to the room at the end of the hallway. All around them, patients were begging for relief.

“Here, I’ll support you,” Barnes wrapped an arm around Morty’s waist and guided him towards a catwalk that lead away from the line up of patients. Once they reached safety, Morty glanced over towards the area where surgery was being performed. The current patient had been rolled into the center of the bay. Two lasers cut intersection incisions into their stomach, and then a mechanical arm reached in and extracted a baby. But, unlike the parent, the newborn infant was green and covered with scales.

As the baby was deposited into a bed, the floor of the bay opened up, and both the patient and the bed dropped out of sight. The floor closed again, and the next patient was rolled into position.

Maxwell desperately tugged at Morty’s arm. “We have to go.” Behind them, Barnes comforted his sobbing daughter.

They turned the corner, and found a hatch that lead out of the assembly room styled horror show. The hallway on the other side of the door was brightly lit and sterile. The three humans lead Morty into a vacant examination room.

“Get him onto the bed, we need to deliver the baby before it’s too late,” Dr. Barnes said. Maxwell closed the door behind them.

“Is Audrey okay? And her baby?”

“Don’t worry, she’s recovering,” Dr. Barnes said. “They seem very aware of who and what she is.” He produced a large needle, and injected Morty with it. “This a painkiller,” he added.

“And her baby?” Morty stammered as he watched the two men assemble a tray of surgical instruments. “Why was it--”

“Reptilian?” Maxwell said. “It’s a long story, but decades ago they approached our government with offers of friendship, but all of that turned out to be a lie. Slowly, they seized control of every government until there was nobody left to resist them.”

“Then they released a virus that killed one quarter of the population. We’re still dealing with it,” Dr. Barnes said. “Over the years, we’ve learned that they’ve never had interest in friendship. They only want two things: to produce food for trade, and to continue their species. They a saw humans as an opportunity to do both.”

Morty moaned. The baby was moving around inside his swollen belly.

“It’s time,” Barnes said. He lifted a cutting tool and aimed it carefully at Morty’s abdomen. “Angel, you might want to look away.”

The doctor pressed a button, and the handheld device whirred to life. A narrow red beam sliced a slit across Morty’s stomach. Once he was finished, Barnes reached in with his gloved hands and removed a tiny, furless baby. He placed it onto a nearby incubator and then turned to examine Morty.

“Now we need to close you up,” he said. He leaned in close, and began applying stitches.

Outside, there was a flurry of activity. Footsteps passed by the closed door.

“We don’t have long,” Maxwell warned.

“I can’t be rushed, and Morty will be incapacitated until the painkiller wears off.”

“Daddy, look at this!”

Maxwell and Barnes followed Angel’s gaze to the newborn. It had all of the characteristics of a human baby, with the exception of a bushy tail and pointed ears which protruded out of its head.

“I think it worked,” Maxwell exclaimed.

“What worked?” Angel asked.

“A plan to engineer a human who is immune to the virus, and can continue our species,” Barnes said.

“It won’t matter unless we can get out of here,” Maxwell said.

Barnes cut off the excess thread. “That should hold. I’ll apply bandages.”

“The bodies,” Morty said groggily. “Where do they go?”

“Food processors, then containment. We suspect that they’re transferred somewhere else.”

“That’s our way out, then,” Morty said. “But, we can’t leave without Audrey.”

“It’s too risky,” Maxwell said.

“No, he’s right. The Repticons are bad enough. We can’t afford going to war against anybody else,” Barnes said.

Morty sat up. “I have an idea.”

Senator Maxwell ducked down on the inside of the stairwell adjacent from the floor’s nurse’s station. Two reptilian attendants sat at terminals. Suddenly, a signal went off for room sixty seven, the room that he had just left. Puzzled, the two reptilians scurried down the hallway.

Maxwell cross into the hallway, and then behind the station. He navigated the controls on the terminal until he reached what he understood as “extraction floor.” He dialed back the power on the conveyor system until he was sure that it had reversed directions.

As he was completing his work, two attendants passed by wearing surgical masks and scrubs. One walked with a limp and had a fluffy fox’s tail.

Maxwell peeked out the access doorway to the extraction bay. Members of the medical staff were working hard to straighten everything out.

Dr. Barnes and Morty were in the mix of the chaos. They were releasing as many patients as they could as they squeezed their way between the beds. As they did so, the freed patients would scatter, moving as quickly as they could considering their condition.

Finally, they reached Audrey’s room. She was cradling her new born baby in her arms.

“Morty,” She exclaimed. “I was worried about you.”

“I’m fine,” he assured her. “But we’re getting out of here.”

“We? Including my baby?”

The two males hesitated. Then, Barnes answered. “Yes, let’s go.”

###

Maxwell had returned to room sixty-seven and retrieved Angel and Morty’s baby. They hurried down the hallway towards the first elevator. The doors parted, revealing that Morty, Dr. Barnes, and Audrey were inside. Angel leaped at her father, and Maxwell stepped into the elevator car.

“The processing plant should be on one of the sub level,” he said as he entered in a floor number. The doors closed, and the elevator began to move again.

“Angel, get behind us,” Barnes urged her. He glanced at the other three. “There’s no telling what we’re going to find down there.”

“Morty?” Angel asked. “Have you thought of a name yet?”

Morty, who had been trying to preserve his strength by leaning against the side of the elevator, looked down. “I hadn’t thought about it. I never even heard if its a girl or a--”

“It’s a girl,” Angel said proudly.

“Then Destiny, I think,” Morty said. He looked at Audrey. “It was at the top of Maureen’s list.”

The elevator eased to a stop, and the doors opened. The group of five found themselves inside a giant chamber filled with containers. The floor was raised up into a dias in the center of the room. There were containers which sat on a track which lead straight into the dias.

“These crates look familiar,” Morty said. He looked at Maxwell, “Are these the same crates you send with the meat in them?”

“Yes,” Maxwell said, looking perplexed. “But I had no idea they were sent by Repticons.”

“Can you repeat the configuration you used before?” Morty asked. “Send us back to my world?”

“Yes, I think so.”

They opened up a shipping container which was closest to the dias, and began emptying it of its cargo. Angel was the first to enter with Destiny, then Audrey with her baby. Morty lingered near the opening, but he leaned weakly against its frame.

Maxwell stepped around the side, holding a portable terminal. “Morty, get inside. Dr. Barnes, you need to go in, too. This setup is different from what we had before. I have to stay behind, to make sure the breach is opened at the right time.”

“But, when they find out?” Barnes asked.

“I’ll say you took me hostage, or something. Just go!”

Morty and the doctor climbed inside. Maxwell sealed the door, then activated the conveyor. He watched the crate containing his friends roll up onto the dias, then activated the machine. The crate was covered with a silver, metallic goo, and then blinked out of existence.
