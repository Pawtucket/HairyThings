<h2>Main Characters</h2>
<b>Detective Mordecai Fox</b> - Mordecai or “Morty” is a part of a two-member team assigned to the case of a missing person in the town of Pawtucket. Fox is married, and a bit of a conspiracy theorist. He is also athletic, and has a sharp mind, the makings of a detective.

<b>Detective Starla Feline</b> - Officer Feline is Fox’s partner, and is the more objective person. She is also quite capable, and more “by the book.”

<b>Margaret Fox</b> - Morty’s wife.

<b>Audrey Berenstein</b> - A search for Audrey has gone on for weeks before she reappears one night in the industrial district of Pawtucket. But, her disappearance leads to the discovery of a much bigger threat.
