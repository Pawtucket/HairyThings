Inside the storage container, the last thing Morty saw was Maxwell entering a command into the computer terminal, and then everything went pitch black. In the next second, Morty felt as if some invisible force had gripped him, squeezing his chest to the point where he was grasping for breath. He and Audrey were tossed against the wall of the container and held there. The world felt like it had begun to spin around.

Morty could hear Derek and Maxwell being thrown about the interior. Their bodies seemed to get the most punishment. Then, Morty’s ears popped and the weight was lifted off his body. He carefully lifted himself up, checking for injuries. That’s when he spotted his taser sitting in the center of the container.

With all of his strength, he reached for the weapon, but his hand was blocked by Derek’s. In one motion, Morty threw his body against Derek’s, pushing him against the far side of the container. Derek’s head slammed against the metal side with a dull thud. Morty then rushed back towards the weapon, scooped it up, and then lifted Audrey’s still limp body off of the floor. With his free hand, he set the taser to its highest setting and blasted the door until it was loose enough to squeeze through.

A stream of cold water started to pour through the crack. Morty sloshed through the water, and pushed through the crack in the door. His feet were numb from the water, which was now as high as his knees. The water outside the container was even higher. Half submerged in the water, Morty clung tight to Audrey’s body and fought to reach somewhere dry.

He looked around, realizing that the warehouse, the restaurant, and the agents’ whose voices he had heard just a few minutes before were all gone. Instead, they were surrounded by rows and rows of houses. It was daylight, but the sun was barely visible through the dense layer of clouds that sat in the sky.

Morty made his way to the backyard of one of the houses which had a back deck that was just high enough to be above the water. He pulled Audrey onto the deck, and gave her a quick check up. Both of them were soaked from head to toe, but other than a scrape on her arm, she didn’t seem to have any major injuries.

Morty tried a door on the deck which lead into the house. It was locked, but his weapon fortunately held enough juice to burn out the mechanism.

Morty moved Audrey to a couch in the living room, then peered out the front window. He could see the edge of the container, but couldn’t tell if there was movement or not. Whatever had happened, their captors had wanted it, and they had the advantage right now of knowing where they were.

Audrey stirred. “What happened?” she muttered.

“I’m not sure, but we’re out of that container,” Morty said, keeping his eyes on the window. He looked towards Audrey, and saw that she had sat up but was shivering.

“Why is it so cold?”

“This area is flooded for some reason,” Morty said. “Somehow we left the warehouse.”

“We did more than leave the warehouse,” Audrey said. “The humans took us back with them.”

“Back?” Morty asked. “I don't understand.”

“Well, good,” Audrey said. “Because it’s classified.”

“What about the meat that was in that warehouse?” Morty shot back. “Is that connected?”

“If I told you ‘no,’ would you believe me?” Audrey said. She started down a nearby hallway. “I’m going to see if there are any towels.”

“Be careful. We’re in somebody’s house.”

“Clothes would be nice, too,” Audrey shouted down the hall.

Morty wandered into the kitchen, and glanced through the cupboards. Most were bare, but the ones that contained cups and dishes seemed to be fully stocked. He found a door that lead into a small bathroom.

Toweling off, Morty peered into the mirror that was mounted over the sink. He studied his red fur, matted from the water. His normally bushy tail was narrow, like a rat’s.

“I can see the container from here,” Audrey shouted. “And I found clothes.”

When Morty joined her, she had already slipped on a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. “Not a perfect fit, but it works,” Audrey said with a shrug.

Morty peered through the bedroom window. He could see the top edge of the container, but there was still no way of knowing the status of their former captors. “It’s odd that there are still clothes left.”

“Perhaps whoever lived here left in a hurry,” Audrey said.

“Look, I understand why you wouldn’t want to tell me what’s going on,” Morty said. “But, it would be really helpful if you explained to me what just happened to us, because if we’re going to undo what they did, I need to know everything.”

“Those two men are representatives from this world to our world,” Audrey said.

“Representatives?”

“Yes, they live on a world dominated by the species homo sapien. But, they refer to themselves as ‘humans.’”

“The missing species?”

“Yeah, if you listen to the conspiracy nuts,” Audrey said, adding a chuckle. “Anyways, they came over with a shipment of goods to our world. They were meeting with my father, when things went off the rails.”

“That’s how you got mixed up with them?” Morty asked.

“They exchanged some heated words with my father, and then took me hostage.”

“Seems odd they would come all of the way here just to cause problems.”

“They’ve been a thorn in my father’s side ever since he took office. Years ago, our country agreed to allow humans access to our world in exchange for certain goods. We had no idea what they were capable of.” Audrey rubbed her protruding belly, which was still visible beneath her jeans.

Morty was about to ask for clarification, when they heard voices and splashing. He glanced out the window, then quickly drew the curtain closed. “One of them is awake. I think it’s the one who worked the controls.”

“Maxwell,” Audrey explained. “He’s the senator.”

“I messed up his comrade pretty good,” Morty said. “If we took that device from him, could we reverse what they did and get back?”

“No, it’s unlocked with a code. Whatever trick they used, it was one-way only.”

“There has to be another way, though,” Morty said. “But, we can’t stay here.” They rummaged around the rest of the second floor, until Morty found a closet with clothes that fit him. He also found a hiker’s backpack.

They were on their way downstairs when they heard a loud whirring sound. “That sounds almost like one of our hovercraft,” Morty said, leaning towards a window. Audrey pulled him away, and then down until they were both crouching out of sight.

“They don’t have hovercraft. That is one of their aircraft, though. Most likely a helicopter.” They waited in silence. The sound intensified, and then died down. A few minutes ago, there was the sputtering sound of an engine starting up, and the whirring sound returned. It grew softer as the craft passed over them, and then departed.

“Maybe we’re in the clear,” Morty said. “They picked up Maxwell.”

“I’m not so sure,” Audrey said. “We need to keep going.”

They searched the rest of the downstairs, loading up Morty’s backpack with supplies. Audrey was the one who discovered a new part of the house which was void of any furniture other than a workbench and a stool. “I think this is their garage, where they park their automobiles,” Audrey said. Morty retrieved a flashlight from his pack, and flicked it on. He shown it along the wall, and then the workbench, until he spotted a hunting knife. He scooped it up, examined the blade, and then slipped it into the front pocket of his backpack.

“What are these humans like?” Morty asked.

“What do you mean?”
“Well, sounds like they are pretty irrationale.”

“Most of them seem pretty nice,” Audrey said. “Actually, my father left them with very little choice. They ran when he threatened their lives.” Audrey picked up a metal baseball up off of the floor, and then gave it a few test swings before moving on. “What” she said in response to Morty’s stare. “I need to defend myself, too.”

“Not a problem,” he said. “This is a new side for you.”

“What, just because I grew up in a rich family, I shouldn’t know how to swing a bat?”

“No, not at all.”

They continued looking until Morty’s pack was full, then exited the house through the same doors they used to come in. They were just about to wade into the water when an arm suddenly reached up and grabbed Audrey by the hand. She let out a shriek. Morty rushed to her aid, but was thrown off balance when something struck him in the leg. A man dressed entirely in black and wearing a scuba mask emerged from beneath the surface of the water, his gun drawn.

Morty swung his body around, and delivering a kick which connected with the man’s shoulder. The gun went askew, and it fired wildly into the air. Morty swung at the man wish his fist, drew the knife from his pack and sank it deep into his adversary’s chest. The man let out a groan, and fell face down into the water.

Audrey’s attacker had her arms pinned and was injecting her with a syringe. Morty clocked him in the head with his paw, then punched him.

“Audrey!”

The tigress sank weakly to her knees, but Morty caught her. Suddenly, there was the sound of a motor, and a small two man boat swung around the far side of the house. It was driven by another human dressed in all black, but this one had longer hair.

Morty recovered Audrey’s bat, and swung it as the boat neared, striking the driver in the chest, then the side of their head. Morty climbed on board then pulled Audrey in. He opened the throttle on the motor, guided them across the backyard, and then out into the street.

“Where did you learn how to fight like that?” Audrey said drowsily.

“I served in the army,” Morty said. He glanced around the boat, then said with a wry smile. “I’m sorry, but I think I lost your bat.”

“That’s okay, I’m more of a hockey fan,” Audrey said, before she drifted to sleep.
