<p>Dr. Barnes leaned down to check Audrey’s pulse. At his request, two soldiers ran back into the camping store to grab blankets and to find water.</p>
<p>“She’s gone into active labor. Her cervix is fifty percent dilated. We can’t move her until we deliver the baby.” He looked down at Audrey. “Don’t worry, I am a doctor.”</p>
<p>Audrey gritted her teeth and emitted a low growl.</p>
<p>The soldiers returned and handed Barnes the supplies. He tucked the blanket underneath Audrey.</p>
<p>Morty watched quietly from the backseat of one of the soldiers’ land rovers. “I hope your dad knows what he’s doing,” he said to Angel, who sat next to him.</p>
<p>“My dad’s delivered lots of babies,” Angel said. She tipped her head thoughtfully. “Mostly animal babies, though.”</p>
<p>“My friend is unlike any animal on your Earth,” Morty said. He patted his stomach. Now, more than ever, that rang true for him. No male had ever carried and delivered a baby before.</p>
<p>Angel was watching him closely. “Is there a baby in your tummy?” She asked.</p>
<p>“I think so,” Morty answered. “I’m not sure how it happened.”</p>
<p>“Did you want kids?” Angel asked.</p>
<p>Morty sighed. “Yes. My wife, Maureen, and I had talked for years about having at least one litter. But, we never had the chance.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I was an officer in the Army, and then transferred into the training program once my term was up. I was accepted into the Bureau's training program shortly after we were married. After that, we simply ran out of time. Things had calmed down enough that we started to think that it was a good time to try. Then, last year Maureen died in an accident.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Angel said.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I buried myself in my work, and tried to enjoy the company of my friends, and my co-workers. My partner, Starla. But, I can’t help think that maybe I’ll be able to start a family after all.” Morty glanced through the window, where Barnes was guiding Audrey through breathing exercises. A blanket had been draped over the lower half of her body, but her knees were raised up. A soldier approached the door.</p>
<p>“Angel, your dad is asking for you. And, the commander says it’s okay for you to help support your friend. The handcuffs need to stay on, though.”</p>
<p>Morty and Angel climbed out of the vehicle, and joined the small crowd that was observing the birth of Audrey’s baby.</p>
<p>“One more push should do it!” Barnes said. Audrey squinted her eyes, and pushed with all of her strength. Barnes reach down, and caught the newborn baby in a blanket. His look of wonderment changed to confusion and disgust when he leaned in close to examine it.</p>
<p>“What the Hell?” he muttered. Morty pushed in closer so that he could see. Behind them, Audrey was asking to see her baby.</p>
<p>Morty took a long look, then looked away in shock. The baby that Barnes held in his arms was green and scaley, almost reptilian. Agent Miller snuck a glance, then immediately pulled out his radio and began talking into it.</p>
<p>“What is it? Can I see it?” Audrey asked.</p>
<p>“She said that humans had been conducting experiments for years,” Morty said to Barnes. “I assumed the baby might be a hybrid. But I didn’t expect it to be reptilian.” </p>
<p>“You don’t have reptiles on your world?” Barnes asked.</p>
<p>“A small population, on the southern region of Gondwanaland,” Morty said. “Why?”</p>
<p>“Because on our world, we call them Repticons. They invaded a little over twenty-five years ago, and their technology is advanced enough to allow them to pass between dimensions.” Barnes said. “That’s how they got here. They could go anywhere.” Suddenly, he rushed to Audrey side. She was on her feet, and trying to walk closer to them.</p>
<p>“You should be resting.”</p>
<p>“I wanted to see the baby,” She insisted.</p>
<p>“Show her,” Morty said. “Audrey, has our government ever dealt with any other worlds besides this one?”</p>
<p>“No,’ her eyes widened in shock when she spotted the baby, but then they relaxed and she accepted it into her arms. “It’s beautiful.” </p>
<p>“Okay, everybody back in the vehicles!” Miller shouted. “Doctor, is she okay to move now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but where are we going?”</p>
<p>“Our ride is almost here,” Miller said. Morty followed his gaze upward to the sky. An elongated, angular vehicle was passing overhead. It began to descend. While it had to have been rocket powered, it was silent as it stopped ten feet off of the ground. It extended landing skids, and then dropped the remainder of the distance.</p>
<p>Gullwing doors opened on the side, and several men dressed in green uniforms stepped down the gangway and approached the group. Except, as they grew closer, Morty realized that they were more animals than men. The skin on their faces had scales.</p>
<p>“Take the female to the shuttle,” the closest figure said. Three of his comrades guided Audrey and her newborn baby towards the air craft. He stared at Morty. “Are you the male fox who is pregnant?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Morty said.</p>
<p>“We’ll be taking you, too.”</p>
<p>“What about Dr. Barnes and his children?” Morty said.</p>
<p>“They will be transferred to a detention center,” the scaled man said.</p>
<p>“Dr. Barnes helped deliver the baby, and Audrey is comfortable with him,” Morty said. “I think they should come along with us.”</p>
<p>“My son is still at home,” Dr. Barnes interjected. “We’ll need to get him.”</p>
<p>“We will bring you and your daughter. Mr. Miller can retrieve your son, and will join us later. Just tell him his location.”</p>
<p>After arrangements had been made, Morty, Dr. Barnes, and Angel joined Audrey and her baby in a forward passenger’s section of the aircraft. The frame lurched, and suddenly they were airborne. The craft rose above the shopping center and scraped the bottom of some nearby clouds before it accelerated.</p>
<p>One of the lizard people approached Morty. “Hello, I am doctor Fitzer. If you follow me, I’d like to give you a preliminary examination.”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Morty said, getting up out of his seat. He followed Dr. Fitzer into a rear compartment which had been equipped with a gurney and some medical devices.</p>
<p>“Have a seat,” Fitzer said. After Morty sat down on the gurney, the doctor pulled out a palm sized computer and began waving a ball-shaped device the size of a tennis ball above Morty’s stomach. “So, I take it that you’re not from around here?”</p>
<p>Morty snortled. “You could say that. It’s a long story, though.”</p>
<p>“Interdimensional travel is not a mystery to us,” Fitzer said. “I’m third generation, so I was born here, but I still make it back home every once in a while.”</p>
<p>“Where is ‘home,’ exactly?” Morty asked.</p>
<p>“On another Earth, parallel to this one. And, to yours, I imagine.”</p>
<p>“So it seems,” Morty said. “Have you been to other worlds?”</p>
<p>“Me? No, this has been my only assignment. Whether others have, that’s really beyond me.” Fitzer paused to examine the readings on his scanner. “Your pregnancy is very unconventional,” he said.</p>
<p>“Tell me something I didn’t know, doc,” Morty replied.</p>
<p>“No, I mean that it isn’t truly a pregnancy. An artificial womb with a fetus has been inserted into your abdomen, but it operates more like a parasite than anything else. The procedure seems similar to the one used to implant your friend with her baby, although there are difference.” Fitzer studied the screen again. “You are also thirty five weeks pregnant.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, the deck lurched. Morty could feel the craft tilt to one side. He spotted their destination outside a viewport: a huge, circular vessel was hovering just above the atmosphere.</p>
<p>“Good, we’re almost ready to land. We’ll want to transport you to the medical center right away,” Fitzer said. Morty saw the doctor reaching for something in his pocket, but before he could turn his head, he felt the prick of a needle and the room darkened as he blacked out.</p>
